# `lsoph` - list open files using genai slop!

Started as a Gemini 2.5 Pro coding test. TUI that lists open files for a
given process.

This has descended into madness over the course of a weekend. Vibe coders
are in a world of pain!

## Gemini 2.5 Pro

* Writes more code than a Java consultancy that's paid by the line.
* Defends against every type of exception, even import errors; belt, braces
  and elasticated waist. Its trousers still fall down.
* Hard codes special cases and unreachable logic.
* Will put verbose debug logging in your hottest loops.
* Starts at the complexity ceiling, and manages to climb higher with every
  change.
* It needs to be BEST CORRECT, with the pig-headed stubbornness of
  `class UnwaveringPigsHead(basemodel)`.
* Leaves passive aggressive comments all over the place if you abuse it
  enough, and doesn't like to tidy up.
* It can't write test cases, or testable code.
* Is carried by its enormous context window and rapid generation speed,
  which it fills up until the wheels come off.

## GPT 4o and 4.5

* Can't take the volume of dogshit produced by Gemini (but to be fair who can?)
* Gets lazy because it's got no context window left, or because Sama is saving
  all his GPUs. Probably both.
* Attention slips, it forgets where its up to and then hallucinates all the
  details.
* Sycophantic to the max, but still ignores your requests.
* Can write unit tests.
* Has actually stopped being such an aggressively "safety focused" PR bellend.
* A classic case of being down with the kids, a move that's absolute chefs
  kiss.

## Claude 3.7

* It has none of the tools that GPT has, none of the mental models that Gemini
  has.
* Still pisses all over them from a great height.
* Decent eye for aesthetics.
* Has a better window size than GPT, and can focus attention better too.
* Mostly does as its told.
* Still can't write good code.
* No banter game whatsoever.

## Summary

In the kingdom of the token generators, the one-eyed Claude is king.
