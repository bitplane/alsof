# `alsof` - list open files TUI

Gemini 2.5 Pro coding test: a TUI that lists open files for a given process.

IMO this is over-engineered slop. I suspect the model was trained on finished
projects then fine-tuned to produce code that is BEST CORRECT according to
people who aren't Python devs.

The result kinda works, but it's high cognitive load and deeply nested special
cases by default.
