# README for AI agents

Hey. Some things to keep in mind:

1. Follow the Zen of Python.
2. I'm using `black` and `isort` to format, so try to align formatting.
3. Pay attention to the imports, don't miss any out.
4. The project is for Python 3.10+, so no old fashioned type hints.
5. Complexity is the enemy of maintainability.
6. If you're given a huge patch at the start of the project, it's an export
   and probably has weeks of dev time squished into one commit.
